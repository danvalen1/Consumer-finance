This folder contains three sample program folders and a documentation folder. Each sample program folder contains the necessary datafiles which allow the programs to run along with a textfile containing sample code for each project. There are three sample projects which correspond with trainings delivered by BLS presenters at various economics conferences around the country. 

Each program folder should contain three datasets and a single textfile containing program specific code:
fmli141x
mtbi141x
expd141

These programs are for demonstration purposes only.  The results obtained are from the 2014 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) public use microdata release, available for download from the CE website (direct link: http://www.bls.gov/cex/pumdhome.htm).  However, they have not been assessed for reliability of any inferences (statistical, economic, or other) derived therefrom.

The documentation folder should contain some conference materials, sample research done using Consumer Expenditure data, and a plain language description of what each project attempts to accomplish.
